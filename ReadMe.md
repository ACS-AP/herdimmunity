# Final Project: Herd Immunity Simulation

You can run the project using python3 test_simulation.py

Created a Simulation of Herd Immunity. This simulation emulates how a virus makes its way through a population. Incorporates factors such as natural immunity, interactions, mortaility rate, population size and more. Enjoy!
